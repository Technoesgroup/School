            MLZS believes in the principle that a good liberal education is a
            participative process, in which the child is a key participant. In
            keeping with the spirit of this principle, we will interact with the
            child in combination with a written exercise. This will facilitate
            us in understanding the childâ€™s readiness for the class to which you
            have applied. The Principal will meet the parent with the child and
            on his approval parents can proceed with the admission.
